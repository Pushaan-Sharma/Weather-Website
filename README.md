# Weather-Website
My project “Weather Website” is about providing the user who wants to know the weather of a certain place, with a serene experience, through easy to use and visually attractive webpage. The site has two input options of country and state; with country being the optional input, which must be filled if two states have the same name for accurate information. The site then displays the current temperature of the location that has been inserted, along with the description, humidity, longitude, and latitude. The website is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and information about the weather has been called through API from https://openweathermap.org/api .
